# MP3_down
You'll need to set proxy in your command prompt/Terminal whatever the case maybe .

For command prompt

    set http_proxy=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT

    set https_proxy=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT
For terminal

    export http_proxy='http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT/'

   export https_proxy='https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT/'

Run mp3_down.py

Enter the name of the artist and the script would download the popular songs of the artist in mp3 format.

The script might fail under improper internet connection or if the multiple songs are present with the same name .

Also some of the songs downloaded might not be downloaded properly.

The script is still under development and has bugs in it , so any and all kinds of help would be highly appreciated .
